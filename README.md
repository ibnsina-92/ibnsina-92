I am a pragmatic, results-driven software developer with a strong foundation in engineering fundamentals, clean code, and system design. I deliver reliable, maintainable solutions that solve real problems and scale with the business. I bring a mindset of continuous improvement, clear communication, and measurable impact.

## About Me
I approach software development as a craft and a discipline. My work centers on producing high-quality systems through:
- Robust design and pragmatic trade-offs
- Clear, maintainable code and strong testing discipline
- Data-informed decisions and monitoring in production
- Mentorship, knowledge sharing, and collaborative ownership

I take pride in shipping features that matter, debugging complex production issues, and turning ambiguous problems into concrete delivery plans. I value clarity over cleverness and resilience over shortcuts.
